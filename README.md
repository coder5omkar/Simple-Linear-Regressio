## üìã General Information
``` 
This repository provides an in-depth understanding and practical implementation of Simple Linear Regression (SLR), a foundational machine learning algorithm. SLR is used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (target) and an independent variable (predictor). It assumes a linear relationship between them and fits a straight line (y = mx + c) to the data.

Key features of this repository include:

Explanation of SLR concepts with mathematical derivations.
Python implementation using numpy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.
Interactive visualizations for better understanding.
Datasets for testing and experimentation.
Performance evaluation metrics like RMSE and R¬≤.
This repo is ideal for beginners and enthusiasts aiming to master linear regression.
